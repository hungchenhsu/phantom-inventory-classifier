abstract: >
  This project provides a unified machine learning framework to detect phantom inventory 
  in retail environments using LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM models. 
  The classifiers are trained on structured inventory, sales, and forecast data, and tuned to achieve 
  high-precision alerting (â‰¥ 0.90) to reduce false positives in stock reconciliation workflows.
  It includes reusable pipelines, thresholds, and evaluation notebooks. Data is excluded due to privacy constraints.
