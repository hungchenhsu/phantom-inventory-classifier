# Phantom Inventory Classifier

Detect phantom inventory in retail store systems using machine learning models (LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM) trained on real-world stock, sales, and forecasting data.

## 🔍 What is Phantom Inventory?

**Phantom inventory** refers to stock that appears in the system but is not actually available in the store, and it's often due to scan errors, shrinkage, or replenishment issues. It leads to:

- Missed sales opportunities
- Wasted replenishment efforts
- False stockout signals

This repository provides a machine learning solution to detect phantom inventory with high precision.

## 🌟 Modeling Process

I experimented with four modeling approaches:

- **LightGBM (LGBM)**: Best performance. Achieved 0.91 precision and 0.76 recall at threshold 0.81.
- **XGBoost**: Also high precision but slightly lower recall.
- **Random Forest**: Solid baseline model.
- **LSTM**: Deep learning sequence model for capturing temporal patterns.

Each model was trained on the same feature set, which includes engineered indicators like:

- `DailyBOH`, `sales_gap`, `forecast_gap`, `inventory_discrepancy`
- Rolling stock ratios
- Day-of-week indicators

I optimized for **Precision ≥ 0.90**, as client stakeholders required high trust in phantom alerts.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hungchenhsu/phantom-inventory-classifier.git
    cd phantom-inventory-classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run inference (within notebook):

    You can run predictions directly using the final `.pkl` pipeline and the saved threshold:

    ```python
    import joblib, json
    import pandas as pd

    # Load model and threshold
    pipeline = joblib.load("model/lgbm/pipeline.pkl")
    tau = json.load(open("model/lgbm/threshold.json"))["precision_floor_threshold"]

    # Load new data
    df = pd.read_csv("data/new_sku_data.csv")

    # Predict phantom flags
    proba = pipeline.predict_proba(df)[:, 1]
    df["phantom_alert"] = (proba >= tau).astype(int)
    df.to_csv("phantom_predictions.csv", index=False)
    ```


Each model folder contains:

- `pipeline.pkl`: Full preprocessing + model pipeline
- `threshold.json`: Tuned threshold for binary decision (precision ≥ 0.90)
- `model_card.pdf`: Summary of training setup and results
